# [ECE20025] Programming Studio (Spring 2025) at HGU

This is a repository for organizing coursework and lab exercises from **[ECE20025] Programming Studio** at Handong Global University (Spring 2025).

The course begins with a brief refresher on essential C language features, then shifts focus to hands-on lab exercises in Java and Data Structures. These labs reinforce theoretical concepts from prior Java and Data Structures courses, with C++ used for implementing data structures.

## Course Focus

- **Refresher on C**  
  Provides a short review of core C language features already covered in previous coursework.

- **Java**  
  Emphasizes practical exercises and labs that reinforce topics from the separate Java course, providing hands-on practice with object-oriented programming and related concepts.

- **Data Structures using C++**  
  Focuses on implementing core data structures—such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees—using C++, building on concepts from the separate Data Structures course.

- **Version Control**  
  Uses Git and GitHub for source code management, collaboration, and version tracking.

- **IDEs**  
  Promotes efficient workflows and project setups in development environments such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ.
